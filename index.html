Next, we need to set up a repository and configure GitHub Pages to host these files. Would you like instructions on how to do this, or should I proceed with creating the repository and configuring it for you?

Please give me instructions.
Sure! Here are the step-by-step instructions to create and host your portfolio on GitHub Pages:

Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
Log in to GitHub: Go to GitHub and log in with your credentials.
Create a New Repository:
Click on the "+" icon at the top right corner and select "New repository".
Name your repository portfolio (or any other name you prefer).
Add a description (optional).
Set the repository to "Public".
Check the box to "Initialize this repository with a README".
Click on "Create repository".
Step 2: Add Portfolio Files
Clone the Repository:

Open a terminal or Git Bash.
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git
Navigate to the Repository:

sh
cd portfolio
Create Markdown Files:

Create the necessary Markdown files (index.md, about.md, experience.md, education.md, publications.md, contact.md) with the content provided earlier.
Here are the commands to create the files:

sh
touch index.md about.md experience.md education.md publications.md contact.md
Add Content to Markdown Files:

Open each file in a text editor and paste the corresponding content provided earlier.
Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages
Create a _config.yml File:

This file is used to configure GitHub Pages.
sh
touch _config.yml
Add Configuration:

Open _config.yml and add the following content:
YAML
title: "Sam Gildas HUMURIZA"
description: "Portfolio"
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
Commit and Push Changes:

Add all files to the repository:
sh
git add .
Commit the changes:
sh
git commit -m "Initial commit with portfolio content"
Push the changes to GitHub:
sh
git push origin main
Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to Repository Settings:

On GitHub, navigate to your repository.
Click on "Settings".
Enable GitHub Pages:

Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar.
Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (e.g., main).
Click "Save".
Wait for Deployment:

GitHub Pages will provide a URL where your portfolio is hosted. It may take a few minutes for the site to be available.
Step 5: Access Your Portfolio
Visit the URL:
The URL will be in the format https://your-username.github.io/portfolio (replace your-username with your GitHub username).
Your portfolio should now be live and accessible at the provided URL. If you need any further assistance or run into any issues, feel free to ask!

How can I review it on localhost?
To review your portfolio on localhost, you can use a local web server to serve the static files. Here's how you can do it:

Using Python's HTTP Server
If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in HTTP server to serve the files locally.

Navigate to Your Repository:

sh
cd path/to/your/portfolio
Start the HTTP Server:

For Python 3:
sh
python -m http.server
For Python 2:
sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Open Your Browser:

Go to http://localhost:8000 to view your portfolio.
Using Node.js and http-server
If you have Node.js installed, you can use the http-server package to serve the files.

Install http-server (if not already installed):

sh
npm install -g http-server
Navigate to Your Repository:

sh
cd path/to/your/portfolio
Start the HTTP Server:

sh
http-server
Open Your Browser:

Go to http://localhost:8080 to view your portfolio.
Using Live Server Extension in VS Code
If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use the Live Server extension to serve the files.

Install Live Server Extension:

Go to the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for "Live Server" and install it.
Open Your Repository in VS Code:

Navigate to your portfolio directory and open it in VS Code.
Start Live Server:

Right-click on the index.md file and select "Open with Live Server".
Alternatively, you can click on the "Go Live" button at the bottom of the VS Code window.
Open Your Browser:

Go to the provided local URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.md).
Using Jekyll (for GitHub Pages)
If you want to simulate how GitHub Pages will render your site, you can use Jekyll.

Install Jekyll and Bundler:

sh
gem install jekyll bundler
Navigate to Your Repository:

sh
cd path/to/your/portfolio
Create a Jekyll Site:

sh
jekyll new . --force
Install Dependencies:

sh
bundle install
Serve the Site:

sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
Open Your Browser:

Go to http://localhost:4000 to view your portfolio.
Choose the method that works best for you based on the tools you have installed and your preferences. If you need further assistance with any of these methods, let me know!

$ git push origin main
git: 'credential-manager-core' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
git: 'credential-manager-core' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/hsamgildas/portfolio.git/'
It looks like you are encountering an authentication issue while trying to push your changes to GitHub. Password authentication has been deprecated, and you should use a personal access token or SSH keys instead. Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

Option 1: Using a Personal Access Token
Generate a Personal Access Token:

Go to GitHub Settings.
Click on "Generate new token".
Select the scopes or permissions you need.
Click "Generate token" and copy the token.
Update Remote URL with Token:

Update the remote URL in your Git repository to use the token.
sh
git remote set-url origin https://<YOUR-TOKEN>@github.com/hsamgildas/portfolio.git
 1 vulnerability detected
Push Your Changes:

Now try pushing your changes again.
sh
git push origin main
Option 2: Using SSH Keys
Generate SSH Key (if you don't have one):

Open a terminal and generate a new SSH key.
sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Follow the prompts to save the key (usually in ~/.ssh/id_ed25519).
Add SSH Key to GitHub:

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard.
sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub SSH Keys Settings.
Click "New SSH key" and paste the key.
Update Remote URL to Use SSH:

Update the remote URL in your Git repository to use SSH.
sh
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:hsamgildas/portfolio.git
Push Your Changes:

Now try pushing your changes again.
sh
git push origin main
Additional Steps
If you're still encountering issues, make sure your Git configuration is set correctly:

sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
And ensure your Git credentials are stored securely:

sh
git config --global credential.helper cache
Once you've set up either the personal access token or SSH key, you should be able to push your changes to GitHub without issues. If you have any further questions or run into other problems, feel free to ask!

bash: ghp_UMhR0boIQ5uxVDD3FOvwOIVIerDg0cOMAv: No such file or directory
It looks like you might have tried to use your personal access token directly in the terminal, which is not the correct approach. Instead, you need to configure Git to use the personal access token for authentication. Here’s how you can do it:

Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token
Go to GitHub Settings.
Click on "Generate new token".
Select the scopes or permissions you need.
Click "Generate token" and copy the token.
Step 2: Update Remote URL with Token
Open your terminal.
Navigate to your repository directory:
sh
cd path/to/your/portfolio
Update the remote URL to include the token:
sh
git remote set-url origin https://<YOUR-TOKEN>@github.com/hsamgildas/portfolio.git
 1 vulnerability detected
Make sure to replace <YOUR-TOKEN> with the actual token you generated.

Step 3: Push Your Changes
Now you can push your changes to GitHub:

sh
git push origin main
This should authenticate your push using the personal access token.

Alternative: Using Git Credential Manager
If you prefer not to include the token in the URL, you can use the Git Credential Manager to securely store your credentials.

Install Git Credential Manager:

On Windows:
sh
git config --global credential.helper manager
On macOS:
sh
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
On Linux:
sh
git config --global credential.helper cache
Push Your Changes:

When you run git push, you will be prompted to enter your GitHub username and personal access token.
If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know!
